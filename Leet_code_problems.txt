Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where:

'.' Matches any single character.​​​​
'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aa", p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
Example 2:

Input: s = "aa", p = "a*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".
Example 3:

Input: s = "ab", p = ".*"
Output: true
Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 20
1 <= p.length <= 20
s contains only lowercase English letters.
p contains only lowercase English letters, '.', and '*'.
It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character '*', there will be a previous valid character to match.

Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', return the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses 
substring
.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "(()"
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest valid parentheses substring is "()".
Example 2:

Input: s = ")()())"
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest valid parentheses substring is "()()".
Example 3:

Input: s = ""
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 3 * 104
s[i] is '(', or ')'.

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
Example 2:

Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
 

Constraints:

n == height.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
0 <= height[i] <= 105

Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 123
Output: 321
Example 2:

Input: x = -123
Output: -321
Example 3:

Input: x = 120
Output: 21
 

Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1

Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division, and mod operator.

The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, 8.345 would be truncated to 8, and -2.7335 would be truncated to -2.

Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.

Note: Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231, 231 − 1]. For this problem, if the quotient is strictly greater than 231 - 1, then return 231 - 1, and if the quotient is strictly less than -231, then return -231.

 

Example 1:

Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 10/3 = 3.33333.. which is truncated to 3.
Example 2:

Input: dividend = 7, divisor = -3
Output: -2
Explanation: 7/-3 = -2.33333.. which is truncated to -2.
 

Constraints:

-231 <= dividend, divisor <= 231 - 1
divisor != 0

A password is considered strong if the below conditions are all met:

It has at least 6 characters and at most 20 characters.
It contains at least one lowercase letter, at least one uppercase letter, and at least one digit.
It does not contain three repeating characters in a row (i.e., "Baaabb0" is weak, but "Baaba0" is strong).
Given a string password, return the minimum number of steps required to make password strong. if password is already strong, return 0.

In one step, you can:

Insert one character to password,
Delete one character from password, or
Replace one character of password with another character.
